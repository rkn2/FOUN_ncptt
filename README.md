# Data-Driven Heritage Preservation: Interactive Educational Suite

## Overview

This repository contains **interactive educational materials** developed for the NCPTT grant: *"Data-Driven Heritage Preservation: Leveraging Machine Learning for Informed Adobe Conservation Strategies"*.

**Designed for All Skill Levels:**
These notebooks use a "Scaffolded Learning" approach:
1.  **No-Code:** Use interactive sliders and buttons to explore concepts.
2.  **Low-Code:** Read explanations of how the logic works.
3.  **Pro-Code:** Inspect the underlying Python code to learn implementation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

**No installation required!** You can run these tutorials directly in your browser using Google Colab.

### 1. Launch the Tutorials

| Lesson | Topic | Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tutorial 1** | Data Exploration & Pattern Analysis | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/rkn2/FOUN_ncptt/blob/main/data_exploration_and_pattern_analysis.ipynb) |
| **Tutorial 2** | Expert-Statistical Intervention Framework | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/rkn2/FOUN_ncptt/blob/main/intervention_matrix_notebook.ipynb) |

### 2. Load the Data (Important!)
When you open the notebooks in Colab, you will need to upload the data file:
1.  Download `synthetic_adobe_data.csv` from this repository.
2.  In Colab, click the **Folder Icon** 📁 on the left sidebar.
3.  Upload the CSV file.

## 📚 The Tutorials

### **Tutorial 1: Data Exploration & Pattern Analysis**
**What you'll do:**
-   **Data Explorer (No-Code):** Use a dropdown menu to visualize different damage types.
-   **Factor Analysis (Low-Code):** Use a slider to group damage types into "Co-occurrence Patterns." See the heatmap update in real-time.
-   **Weight Recovery (Low-Code):** Use Elastic Net to recover the implicit weights of the scoring system and identify which conditions drive the Total Score.

### **Tutorial 2: Expert-Statistical Intervention Framework**
**What you'll do:**
-   **Matrix Builder:** Interactively build an intervention priority matrix by combining statistical importance (from Tutorial 1) with preservation ethics.
-   **The Budget Game:** You set the budget! Define your total funds and unit costs, then use sliders to allocate repairs. Try to maximize your preservation score without going over your limit.

## 🎓 For Instructors

**Learning Objectives:**
1.  **Conceptual:** Understand Factor Analysis and Elastic Net / Weight Recovery without getting bogged down in syntax.
2.  **Applied:** Translate statistical findings into preservation decisions.
3.  **Technical:** (Optional) Learn the Python implementation of these methods.

**Customization:**
You can modify the `generate_synthetic_data.py` script to simulate different types of heritage structures (e.g., masonry bridges, timber frames) to adapt the tutorials for other domains.
