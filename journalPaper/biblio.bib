   abstract = {Historic adobe structures pose a high seismic risk mainly because of the poor out-of-plane bending response of their walls that may produce fatalities and significant economic, cultural, and heritage losses. In this paper, we propose a retrofitting technique that increases the wall strength for both in-plane and out-of-plane directions. This technique consists of vertical and horizontal timber elements symmetrically installed on each face of the wall to form a confining wood frame, supplemented with vertical tensors that pre-compress the wall. This study evaluates the performance of this retrofitting technique with a two-set experimental program on full-scale historic adobe walls. On the first set, four specimens were subjected to a static overturning test with boundary conditions representing the confinement effect at both ends by orthogonal walls. On the second set, three full-scale specimens, one unretrofitted and two retrofitted, were subjected to four ground motion records on a shaking table to assess the out-of-plane dynamic behavior of typical corner walls. The unretrofitted specimen collapsed during the second motion (peak ground acceleration [PGA] = 0.39 g), while both retrofitted walls survived all four motions (maximum PGA of 0.75 g) proving the high effectiveness of the proposed retrofitting. The addition of base anchors as a variation of the retrofitting technique significantly reduced the rocking effects and the residual drifts of the system, thus improving its overall seismic performance. Further research is needed to develop guidelines for seismic retrofit of heritage buildings including multistory full-scale tests of specimens with various types of openings and retrofitting strategies that minimize their architectural impact.},

In 2015, the Zhengzhou Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology discovered the earliest adobe house in Prehistoric China at the Qingtai Site. In this work, physical properties, material composition, and microstructure of the adobe brick and other earth samples gathered in this adobe house were studied. The results showed that the density and surface hardness of the adobe brick reached 2.12 g/cm and 91 HA, which was second only to the rammed house floor sample. The adobe brick contained about 13.2% of plant fiber, and in its inorganic composition, the clay cement with particle size less than 0.075 mm accounted for 90%. The results of XRD analysis showed that the content of kaolinite in adobe brick was 2–5 times that of other samples. The structure analysis displayed that the adobe brick was much more compact, and its porosity was about 28.6%. These research results demonstrated that the adobe brick was formed under a certain pressure and its raw materials were different from those of other samples in this adobe house.},

   abstract = {Because so many ancestral populations, at various times, have lived within the constraints of earthen architectural technology, it has significant representation in building traditions across large temporal and geographic expanses. Adobe, known also as dagga, ferey, cob, and by other names, is a variant in which clays and other sediments are combined with organic materials and formulated into discrete construction components, often in communities of practice for which adobe recipes, preparation, and application are integral to daily intersections of home and community. For archaeologists, community partners, and interested publics who wish to learn more about it, a large portion of this architectural culture is no longer visible above the surface but is accessible through archaeology. Yet low impact sampling, such as probing and test excavation, rarely reveals adobe features. Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) allows a tantalizing and non-invasive perspective on subsurface adobe features; increasingly there is a buried structural landscape emerging at sites where adobe architecture prevailed. The case studies presented here from 18th and 19th century sites in central and southern California serve as a guide for further survey.},

The role of the housing sector in the country is critical as it accounts for half of the total national electricity consumption. It is important to apply sustainable energy concepts in this sector, and the application of Zero-Energy Homes (ZEHs) could be an appropriate option in this regard. In ZEHs, the energy demand needs to be reduced significantly before employing renewable energy, and a way to achieve that is through applying vernacular construction techniques and materials. This study aims to investigate the role of courtyard, mushrabiyah and adobe construction for the development of ZEHs in the five main Saudi climatic zones represented by Dhahran, Guriat, Riyadh, Jeddah and Khamis Mushait. A base house is designed, modelled and compared with measured electricity values. The comparison between the base house and the houses adapted with these techniques and materials is undertaken based on the annual electricity demand and the maximum power demand, and findings reveal that mushrabiyah can reduce them by 4% and 3%, respectively, while adobe can reduce them by 6% and 19%, respectively. Courtyards are found to be not helpful in terms of energy saving.},

Adobe structures are particularly susceptible to seismic forces due to their substantial mass and low tensile capacity. In addition, adobe is affected negatively by moisture that may penetrate from the ground or through the plaster. This paper describes the preliminary findings of an experimental program to investigate the effect of higher water content in the lower part of the wall on the wall strength behaviour under lateral loading. Lateral load tests were conducted on two quarter-scale adobe walls, one in air-dry condition (Wall 1) and another with greater water content in the lower part (Wall 2). The model walls demonstrated similar behaviour during loading in terms of deflections; however, the higher water content in the lower part had a significant effect on the wall strength. The in-plane (lateral) load capacity of Wall 2 was approximately 74% of the capacity of Wall 1.},

These rammed earth walls were constructed and exposed for 20 years to natural weathering, in a wet continental climate. None of these walls have shown complete collapse to date. A method to measure the rammed earth walls erosion by stereo-photogrammetry has been developed. The result shows that the mean erosion depth of the studied walls is about 2 mm (0.5% wall thickness) in the case of rammed earth wall stabilised with 5% by dry weight of hydraulic lime and about 6.4 mm (1.6% wall thickness) in the case of unstabilised rammed earth walls. The stabilisation enables to not use any plaster to protect the walls. In the case of the unstabilised rammed earth walls, an extrapolated lifetime longer than 60 years can be assessed. This shows a potential for the use of unstabilised rammed earth in the similar climatic conditions with this study. The method of stereo-photogrammetry used to measure the erosion of rammed earth walls on site may also help to calibrate and develop more pertinent laboratory test to assess the durability of rammed earth wall. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Adobe has been used globally for millennia. In the US Southwest, cultural heritage sites made of adobe materials have lasted hundreds of years in an arid/semi-arid environment. A common prediction across multiple climate change models, however, is that rainfall intensity will increase in the US Southwest. This increased erosivity threatens the long-term protection and preservation of these sites, and thus resource managers are faced with selecting effective conservation practices. For this reason, modeling tools are needed to predict climate change impacts and plan for adaptation strategies. Many existing strategies, including patching damaged areas, building protective caps and shelter coating walls are already commonly utilized. In this study, we modeled adobe block construction, subjected extant walls to a local 100-year return interval rainfall intensity, and tested earthen-coat-based strategies to minimize the deterioration of earthen fabric. Findings from the resultant linear models indicate that the patching of earthen architecture alone will not prevent substantial damage, while un-amended encapsulation coats and caps provide similar, and significantly greater protection than patching. The use of this model will enable local heritage resource managers to better target preservation methods for a return on investment of the material and labor costs, resulting in better preservation overall and the retention of culturally valuable resources.},

   abstract = {Nowadays, rammed earth construction is attracting renewed interest throughout the world thanks to its "green" characteristics in the context of sustainable development. Firstly, using a local material (soil on site or near the site), rammed earth constructions have very low embodied energy. Secondly, rammed earth houses have an attractive appearance and present advantageous living comfort due to substantial thermal inertia and the "natural regulator of moisture" of rammed earth walls. This is why several research studies have been carried out recently to study the mechanical and thermal characteristics of rammed earth. However, to our knowledge, there are not yet sufficient studies on the tensile strength and the shear strength of rammed earth. The tensile strength of rammed earth is neglected in general due to its very low value, but in extreme conditions (e.g., seismic conditions), knowing the tensile strength is necessary for structural design. Moreover, the shear strength is required in many cases to check the local failure of rammed earth quickly, which has been observed in old structures (especially those submitted to concentrated loads). This paper presents experimental results on tensile strengths and the Poisson ratio of rammed earth specimens. Local failure tests were also conducted on 1 m × 1 m × 0.3 m wallettes manufactured in the laboratory. The shear strength was then identified using a simple method based on compressive strength, tensile strength and Mohr's circle theory. The approach proposed was validated by tests on the wallettes. Finite Element (FE) modeling was also carried out to confirm the results. Last, the method presented was validated for stabilized rammed earth lintels presented in the literature. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Rammed earth is attracting renewed interest throughout the world thanks to its “green” characteristics in the context of sustainable development. Several research studies have thus recently been carried out to investigate this material. Some of them attempted to simulate the rammed earth’s mechanical behavior by using analytical or numerical models. Most of these studies assumed that there was a perfect cohesion at the interface between earthen layers. This hypothesis proved to be acceptable for the case of vertical loading, but it could be questionable for horizontal loading. To address this problem, discrete element modeling seems to be relevant to simulate a rammed earth wall. To our knowledge, no research has been conducted thus far using discrete element modeling to study a rammed earth wall. This paper presents an assessment of the discrete element modeling’s robustness for rammed earth walls. Firstly, a brief description of the discrete element modeling is presented. Then the parameters necessary for discrete element modeling of the material law of the earthen layers and their interfaces law following the Mohr–Coulomb model with a tension cut-off and post-peak softening were given. The relevance of the model and the material parameters were assessed by comparing them with experimental results from the literature. The results showed that, in the case of vertical loading, interfaces did not have an important effect. In the case of diagonal loading, model with interfaces produced better results. Interface characteristics can vary from 85 to 100% of the corresponding earthen layer’s characteristics.},

The numerical results are validated by comparing the calculated catch ratio values and cumulative WDR amounts with data from the field measurements. The CFD simulations accurately estimate the WDR intensities at the positions of 18 WDR gauges. The average discrepancies between the numerical and experimental results are found to be 6.9% for the rain event on February 20-21, 2014 and 4.9% for the rain event on August 2-3, 2014. In different building configurations, the influences of recirculation regions, sheltering, wind-blocking effect and acceleration of wind determine the WDR distribution on the downstream building. WDR can increase due to recirculation regions and acceleration of wind, while wind-blocking effect and sheltering decrease WDR.},

Numerical prediction of this phenomenon requires knowledge of wind speed, rain drop sizes and rain fall intensity among others. The wind speed and rain drop sizes are usually calculated from field measurements. Rainfall intensity is usually assumed to follow a generalized Pareto distribution. Studies have indicated that the rain drop sizes are a function of the rainfall intensity. From a design optimization perspective, it is unclear what value of rainfall intensity should be considered in the process. This paper seeks to examine that in detail. Rain over a simplified building is chosen as the representative test case. The results suggest that it is the lower rainfall intensities that are more critical to be considered in the design process. A combination of using both the median as well as the mean rainfall intensities is proposed for the same.},

However, a limitation of existing methods is the manual comparison process to ascertain damage origins. This research outlines a method combining physics-based modeling and data-driven approaches to automate diagnostics for existing masonry structures. This method was shown to quantitatively reproduce the cause of damage for complex, 3D structures and was validated against a laboratory-scale experimental masonry wall. The newly automated procedure increases throughput by 105 times compared to our prior method, allowing for the testing of orders of magnitude more hypotheses than were previously possible. Although the approach is demonstrated here for settlement-induced cracking, it has important implications for the broader topic of data-driven masonry diagnostics.},

While BO has been applied successfully in many applications, modern optimisation tasks usher in new challenges where conventional methods fail spectacularly. In this work, we present Dragonfly, an open source Python library for scalable and robust BO. Dragonfly incorporates multiple recently developed methods that allow BO to be applied in challenging real world settings; these include better methods for handling higher dimensional domains, methods for handling multi-fidelity evaluations when cheap approximations of an expensive function are available, methods for optimising over structured combinatorial spaces, such as the space of neural network architectures, and methods for handling parallel evaluations. Additionally, we develop new methodological improvements in BO for selecting the Bayesian model, selecting the acquisition function, and optimising over complex domains with different variable types and additional constraints. We compare Dragonfly to a suite of other packages and algorithms for global optimisation and demonstrate that when the above methods are integrated, they enable significant improvements in the performance of BO.

   abstract = {Point clouds are one of the most primitive and fundamental surface representations. A popular source of point clouds are three dimensional shape acquisition devices such as laser range scanners. Another important field where point clouds are found is in the representation of high-dimensional manifolds by samples. With the increasing popularity and very broad applications of this source of data, it is natural and important to work directly with this representation, without having to go to the intermediate and sometimes impossible and distorting steps of surface reconstruction. A geometric framework for comparing manifolds given by point clouds is presented in this paper. The underlying theory is based on Gromov-Hausdorff distances, leading to isometry invariant and completely geometric comparisons. This theory is embedded in a probabilistic setting as derived from random sampling of manifolds, and then combined with results on matrices of pairwise geodesic distances to lead to a computational implementation of the framework. The theoretical and computational results here presented are complemented with experiments for real three dimensional shapes.},

Thus, this distance can he used to determine the degree of resemblance between two objects that are superimposed on one another. In this paper, we provide efkient algorithms for computing the Hausdorff distance between all possible relative positions of a binary image and a model. We focus primarily on the case in which the model is only allowed to translate with respect to the image. Then, we consider how to extend the techniques to rigid motion (translation and rotation). The Hausdorff distance computation differs from many other shape comparison methods in that no correspondence between the model and the image is derived. The method is quite tolerant of small position errors such as those that occur with edge detectors and other feature extraction methods. Moreover, we show how the method extends naturally to the problem of comparing a portion of a model against an image. Index Terms-Distance transforms, model-based recognition, Voronoi surface. I. INTRODUC~ION CENTRAL problem in pattern recognition and computer A vision is determining the extent to which one shape differs from another. Pattern recognition operations such as correlation and template matching (cf. [ 171) and model-based vision methods (cf. [4], [8], [ll]) can all be viewed as techniques for determining the difference between shapes. We have recently been investigating functions for determining the degree to which two shapes differ from one another. The goal of these investigations has been to develop shape comparison methods that are efficient to compute, produce intuitively reasonable results, and have a firm underlying theoretical basis. In order to meet these goals, we argue that it is important for shape comparison functions to obey metric properties (see [3] for related arguments). In this paper, we present algorithms for efficiently computing the Hausdorff distance between all possible relative positions of a model and an image. (The Hausdorff distance is a max-min distance defined below.) We primarily focus on the case in which the model and image are allowed to translate with respect to one another and then briefly consider extensions to handle the more general case of rigid motion. There are theoretical algorithms for efficiently computing the Hausdorff distance as a function of translation [12], [14] and Manuscript rigid motion [13]. Here, we provide provably good approximation algorithms that are highly efficient both in theory and in practice. These methods operate on binary rasters, making them particularly well suited to image processing and machine vision applications, where the data are generally in raster form. The three key advantages of the approach are as follows: 1) Relative insensitivity to small perturbations of the image 2) simplicity and speed of computation 3) natural allowance for portions of one shape to be com-We discuss three different methods of computing the Haus-dorff distance as a function of the translation of a model with respect to an image. The first of these methods is similar in many ways to binary correlation and convolution, except that the Hausdorff distance is a nonlinear operator. The second method extends the definition of the distance function to enable the comparison of portions of a model to portions of an image. The third method improves on the first two by using certain properties of the Hausdorff distance to rule out many possible relative positions of the model and the image without having to explicitly consider them. This speeds up the computation by several orders of magnitude. All three of these methods can be further sped up using special-purpose graphics hardware (in particular, a z buffer). We present a number of examples using real images. These examples illustrate the application of the method to scenes in which a portion of the object to be identified is hidden from view. Then finally, we show how the methods can be adapted to comparing objects under rigid motion (translation and rotation). pared with another. A.

   abstract = {This paper proposes a novel algorithm for fast and accurate Hausdorff distance (HD) computation. The Hausdorff distance is used to measure the similarity between two point sets in various applications. However, it is hard to compute the HD algorithm efficiently between very large-scale point sets while ensuring the accuracy of the HD. The directed HD algorithm has two loops (called the outer loop and the inner loop) for calculating MAX-MIN distance, and the state-of-the-art algorithms, such as the Early break method and the Diffusion search method, focused on reducing the iterations of the inner loop. Our algorithm, however, concentrates on reducing the iterations of the outer loop. The proposed method simultaneously computes the temporary HD and temporary minimum distances of points corresponding to the outer loop using the opposite HD computation with very small systematic samples. Thereafter, a strategy of ruling out is employed to exclude non-contributing points. The new approach reduces the problems of different grid sizes and highly overlapping point sets as well as the very large-scale point sets. 3-D point clouds and real brain tumor segmentation (MRI 3-D volumes) are used for comparing the performance of the proposed algorithm and the state-of-the-art HD algorithms. In experimental results with 3-D point clouds, the proposed method is more than at least 1.5 times as faster as the compared algorithms. And, in experimental results with MRI 3-D volumes, the proposed method achieves a better performance than the compared algorithms over all pairs regardless of the grid size. Thus, as a whole, the proposed algorithm outperforms the compared algorithms.},

   abstract = {The response surface (RS) method based on radial basis functions (RBFs) is proposed to model the input-output system of large-scale structures for model updating in this article. As a methodology study, the complicated implicit relationships between the design parameters and response characteristics of cable-stayed bridges are employed in the construction of an RS. The key issues for application of the proposed method are discussed, such as selecting the optimal shape parameters of RBFs, generating samples by using design of experiments, and evaluating the RS model. The RS methods based on RBFs of Gaussian, inverse quadratic, multiquadric, and inverse multiquadric are investigated. Meanwhile, the commonly used RS method based on polynomial function is also performed for comparison. The approximation accuracy of the RS methods is evaluated by multiple correlation coefficients and root mean squared errors. The antinoise ability of the proposed RS methods is also discussed. Results demonstrate that RS methods based on RBFs have high approximation accuracy and exhibit better performance than the RS method based on polynomial function. The proposed method is illustrated by model updating on a cable-stayed bridge model. Simulation study shows that the updated results have high accuracy, and the model updating based on experimental data can achieve reasonable physical explanations. It is demonstrated that the proposed approach is valid for model updating of large and complicated structures such as long-span cable-stayed bridges. © 2012 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering.},

   abstract = {© 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers. Parameter selection is a key step in finite-element-model updating (FEMU) because it determines whether the task of FEMU is successful or not. The as-built engineering structures are inevitably subject to many sources of uncertainty such as geometric dimension variability due to manufacture process, inherent random variation of materials, and imprecisely known boundary conditions. Uncertainty involving parameters challenges the task of parameter selection in FEMU. In this paper, the powerful global sensitivity analysis (GSA) is proposed to perform parameter selection in FEMU when uncertainty exists. The Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) method is extensively adopted to perform GSA. However, the brute-force MCS method is likely to be unaffordable and impractical because it entails a large number of model evaluations due to its slow convergence. Therefore, the Gaussian process metamodel is used as the surrogate model of the time-consuming finite-element model to ease the heavy computational burden. Gaussian process metamodel is favored here because of its probabilistic, nonparametric features and high capability of modeling a complex physical system. The space-filling Sobol sequence sampling method is utilized to generate the informative training data for establishing the Gaussian process metamodel. Finally, two study cases of the simple flat steel plate and full-scale arch bridge are presented to detail the procedure of employing the proposed GSA method to select parameters for FEMU.},

Over the next several decades, the world's reliance on cloud computing and big data will continuously increase, and new data-centric technologies and engineering approaches will be developed. Due to this rapidly developing field, there is a need to track these trends and incorporate the corresponding developments into our current science and engineering curriculum. Besides data science skills already taught in traditional engineering curricula, such as mathematical, computational, and statistical foundations, the National Academies guide discusses that key concepts in developing data acumen include domain-specific considerations and ethical problem-solving. This work-in-progress (WIP) paper will highlight the foundation of a comprehensive study to explore data science education in two domain-specific programs: material science and engineering and architectural engineering. This project is broken down into the following objectives: 1) facilitate data science education and workforce development for engineering and related topics, 2) provide opportunities for students to participate in practical experiences where they can learn new skills through opportunities in new settings to transform data science education, and 3) expand the data science talent pool by enabling the participation of undergraduate students with diverse backgrounds, experiences, skills, and technical maturity. The paper will focus on the topics, deployment strategies within courses and curricula, establishing data sets, representative examples of work-in-progress efforts and their success.},

Sometimes, clusters and outliers are inseparable, especially for those point clouds with outliers. Most of the cluster-based algorithms can well identify cluster outliers but sparse outliers. We develop a novel clustering method, called spatial neighborhood connected region labeling. The method defines spatial connectivity criterion, finds points connections based on the connectivity criterion among the k-nearest neighborhood region and classifies connected points to the same cluster. Our method can accurately and quickly classify datasets using only one parameter k. Comparing with K-means, hierarchical clustering and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise methods, our method provides better accuracy using less computational time for data clustering. For applications in the outlier detection of the point cloud, our method can identify not only cluster outliers, but also sparse outliers.

These risks can be mitigated by structural health monitoring, but it is difficult to monitor the state of the entire structure using discrete measurements. In this study, we propose a scheme for estimating spatially varying elastic modulus fields of a structural element using differentiable physics to support structural health monitoring efforts. Our approach is evaluated on two numerical model systems, a cantilever beam and a simply supported beam, and systematically evaluated for its sensitivity to initialization, boundary conditions, and a wide variety of spatially varying modulus fields. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in finding structures with matching displacement responses, while also highlighting its limitations in recovering accurate material properties, as is common in with all inverse methods. To address these limitations, we employ regularization techniques including blur filters and Heaviside projection to mitigate degeneracy and recover more complex fields. This work lays the foundation for more informed decision-making in structural health monitoring, with especially close applications to digital image correlation based approaches.},

   abstract = {Adaptive reuse is a challenging problem that combines spatial, structural, and architectural requirements, along with current restrictions in design, enhanced in buildings with heritage value. In this scenario, generative design techniques allow for exploring different arrangements for a pre-defined problem, assisting professionals during complex design tasks. Therefore, this work explores the potential of Shape Grammars in generating solutions for the adaptive reuse of Sobrado buildings, the prevalent typology in the historic center of São Luís. This paper focuses on the computational implementation of the transformation rules using rhino script syntax and python. The methodology proposes a framework for adapting buildings into multi-family apartments, considering existing spatial and structural requirements. It investigates the allocation of three apartment types in the floor plan: studios, one-bedroom, and two-bedroom apartments. The adopted strategy for the distribution of internal spaces considers existing elements, such as windows and balconies, allowing to benefit from the natural daylighting characteristics of the buildings, following the original projects during the XVIII and XIX centuries. An interactive approach is implemented to explore the potential of generating diverse spatial arrangements during the adaptive reuse process. In the last decade, a rising effort to improve sustainable solutions due to climate change has impacted how we design cities and buildings. The construction & demolition (C&D) building sector represented around 37% of CO2 emissions and 34% of energy consumption in 2022 (United Nations, 2022). Thus, more than re-imagining how we sustainably design new buildings, we should develop solutions that preserve the existing building stock, adapting it to modern user needs. In this context, adaptive reuse (AR) of cultural heritage buildings can reduce material waste and maximize embodied energy use (Foster and Kreinin, 2020). It also can contribute to preserving cultural heritage elements and sites and ensuring a sense of community through how people interact with existing buildings. Defining frameworks that support adaptive reuse strategies can facilitate the development and execution of AR projects. In this context, Shape Grammars (SG) is a powerful tool for generating design solutions and defining rules to describe transformations in design processes (Duarte, 2005; Eloy and Duarte, 2015; Ligler, 2021). Defining grammar-based computational tools can advance the generation of design options for a given Volume 2-Digital Design Reconsidered-eCAADe 41 | 691},

   abstract = {The historical center of São Luis is host to a diverse historic and urban ensemble, reminiscent of the 18th and 19th centuries. The architectural typology which can be found there illustrates the strong influence drawn from the Portuguese style known as Pombalino, developed during the reconstruction process of Lisbon after the 1755 earthquake. Due to the historical relevance of these buildings which encapsulate this period in time, it is important to preserve and maintain the buildings located in this region. Adaptive reuse projects have an important role to play in preserving architectural ensembles like this. The first part of the adaptive process is to document and understand the original configuration of the building with the aim of maintaining the elements with historical relevance. Therefore, this project proposes the use of a shape grammar approach to analyze floor plans, aiming to further contribute to adaptive reuse projects for ĝ€ Sobrado' buildings. The process focuses specifically on a case study building and aims to document and identify the specific placement of elements in the floor plan in an effort to provide a deeper understanding of future adaptive reuse.},

   abstract = {Environmental conditions, variability in building material, and fabrication error are several contributors that shorten a structure's service life. While infrastructure might not have visible exterior damage, there is always the risk for failure due to internal or obscured damage. There has been growing research in the area of Nondestructive testing. However, these methods often disregard uncertainties in the construction and maintenance processes. Nevertheless, providing an accurate and robust method for detecting, localizing, and estimating the severity of existing damage relies on parameterizing uncertainties surrounding material properties, composition, and loading history. This work combines conventional physics-based modeling with data-driven search strategies to infer unobservable information about the structure. The proposed approach uses Finite Element Analysis with automated adjoint calculation to efficiently obtain gradients in the solution with respect to the model parameters. The hybrid model updates the postulated material properties to match the mechanical compliance of a simulated structure with observations from a reference structure. Here we use a simple cantilever beam model to study and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In addition, we analyze the results from multiple search strategies used to obtain the mechanical properties. We find that the benefit in search efficiency gained from the analytical evaluation of the gradients is offset by the additional computational cost of adjoint simulation compared to gradient-free search. However, we expect that the benefit of adjoint simulation would be more pronounced in problems with more degrees of freedom.},

   abstract = {On August 4th, 2020, a colossal blast at the port of the Lebanese capital, one of the largest in history not caused by a nuclear reaction, changed Beirut’s historic neighborhoods within seconds from a busy, vibrant and living cultural hub into an urban fabric of shattered buildings, collapsed masonry walls and scratched pitched roofs. With not enough preparedness for such a calamitous event, the affected local community faced significant challenges as they attempted to recover from the damage done. Once a heritage site is lost, damaged or destroyed, the recovery and rehabilitation process is slow, if (at all) possible. In the wake of such events, there has been a growing interest to digitize historic sites and buildings to preserve them (digitally) against unforeseen threats such as natural or man-made disasters. However, little work has been done to explore the role of 3D documentation for post-blast inspection of masonry historic buildings. The objective of this work is to expose an efficient workflow for accelerating the assessment process of damaged historic buildings by the application of digital technology in post-disaster areas, through the case study on the Beirut Blast. The originality of this work resides in the fact that this was the first time ever that Beirut and its historic buildings were massively digitized. This paper outlines how and why 3D image-based modeling was implemented, emphasizing on the timely benefits for disaster recovery and improvement of decision making in a similar emergency case. The results of the documentation produced a fast yet accurate 3D models of the affected historic buildings in Beirut, despite the challenging structural properties of the post-blast built environment. Post-processing of the data provided cultural heritage experts and engineers with valuable documents for structural deficiencies, damages and accessibility, which facilitated the remote assessment of the buildings and accelerated the implementation of emergency interventions.},

Masonry buildings comprise a significant portion of the built heritage environment for most countries and are susceptible to natural hazards. However, research at the intersection of extreme wind loading and structural strengthening often neglects historic and aging infrastructure, particularly unreinforced masonry buildings, leading to their exclusion from the building code. This study aims to identify various factors that affect damages to unreinforced masonry structures during tornado loading. To begin, the structural performance of historic masonry constructions after the Mayfield, KY tornado in 2021 was evaluated, with multimodal data collected on-site, including aerial photographs, street-view imagery, and detailed field notes on observed damages. The on-site data included aerial photographs, street-view imagery, and detailed field notes for the observed damages. This data was supplemented by archival research and analyzed to identify the underlying relationships between building attributes and damage levels. The results indicate that damages in historic buildings were extensive and proportional to the year of construction and the distance from the tornado but not necessarily to the retrofit status.},

Rammed earth construction is an ancient technique which is attracting renewed interest throughout the world today. Although rammed earth is currently regarded as a promising material in the construction sector in the context of sustainable development, it is still difficult to quantify its durability, as well as its thermal and mechanical performances, which discourages people from using it. This paper is devoted to the study of the last problem. Three different scales were studied. The first is the scale of in-situ walls. Dynamic measurements were carried out on site to determine the Eigen frequencies of the walls. The elastic modulus was determined from the frequencies measured by using a finite element model. The second is the scale of a representative volume element (RVE). Rammed earth RVE samples with dimensions similar to those of the walls on site were manufactured and tested in the laboratory. Finally, at the last scale, called the micro-mechanical scale, tests were performed on equivalent compressed earth blocks (CEBs), which can replace the rammed earth RVE samples to facilitate laboratory tests.},

Then, the walls’ soil was recycled and reused for manufacturing of new specimens which represented the initial state.

Firstly, using a local material (soil on site or near the site), rammed earth constructions have very low embodied energy. Secondly, rammed earth houses have an attractive appearance and present advantageous living comfort due to substantial thermal inertia and the “natural regulator of moisture” of rammed earth walls. This is why several research studies have been carried out recently to study the mechanical and thermal characteristics of rammed earth. However, to our knowledge, there are not yet sufficient studies on the tensile strength and the shear strength of rammed earth. The tensile strength of rammed earth is neglected in general due to its very low value, but in extreme conditions (e.g., seismic conditions), knowing the tensile strength is necessary for structural design. Moreover, the shear strength is required in many cases to check the local failure of rammed earth quickly, which has been observed in old structures (especially those submitted to concentrated loads). This paper presents experimental results on tensile strengths and the Poisson ratio of rammed earth specimens. Local failure tests were also conducted on 1m×1m×0.3m wallettes manufactured in the laboratory. The shear strength was then identified using a simple method based on compressive strength, tensile strength and Mohr’s circle theory. The approach proposed was validated by tests on the wallettes. Finite Element (FE) modeling was also carried out to confirm the results. Last, the method presented was validated for stabilized rammed earth lintels presented in the literature.},

   abstract = {Rammed earth is attracting renewed interest throughout the world thanks to its “green” characteristics in the context of sustainable development. Several research studies have thus recently been carried out to investigate this material. Some of them attempted to simulate the rammed earth’s mechanical behavior by using analytical or numerical models. Most of these studies assumed that there was a perfect cohesion at the interface between earthen layers. This hypothesis proved to be acceptable for the case of vertical loading, but it could be questionable for horizontal loading. To address this problem, discrete element modeling seems to be relevant to simulate a rammed earth wall. To our knowledge, no research has been conducted thus far using discrete element modeling to study a rammed earth wall. This paper presents an assessment of the discrete element modeling’s robustness for rammed earth walls. Firstly, a brief description of the discrete element modeling is presented. Then the parameters necessary for discrete element modeling of the material law of the earthen layers and their interfaces law following the Mohr–Coulomb model with a tension cut-off and post-peak softening were given. The relevance of the model and the material parameters were assessed by comparing them with experimental results from the literature. The results showed that, in the case of vertical loading, interfaces did not have an important effect. In the case of diagonal loading, model with interfaces produced better results. Interface characteristics can vary from 85 to 100% of the corresponding earthen layer’s characteristics.},

Secondly, rammed earth houses have an attractive appearance and present advantageous living comfort due to substantial thermal inertia and the “natural regulator of moisture” of rammed earth walls. This is why several research studies have been carried out recently to study the mechanical and thermal characteristics of rammed earth. However, to our knowledge, there are not yet sufficient studies on the tensile strength and the shear strength of rammed earth. The tensile strength of rammed earth is neglected in general due to its very low value, but in extreme conditions (e.g., seismic conditions), knowing the tensile strength is necessary for structural design. Moreover, the shear strength is required in many cases to check the local failure of rammed earth quickly, which has been observed in old structures (especially those submitted to concentrated loads). This paper presents experimental results on tensile strengths and the Poisson ratio of rammed earth specimens. Local failure tests were also conducted on 1m×1m×0.3m wallettes manufactured in the laboratory. The shear strength was then identified using a simple method based on compressive strength, tensile strength and Mohr’s circle theory. The approach proposed was validated by tests on the wallettes. Finite Element (FE) modeling was also carried out to confirm the results. Last, the method presented was validated for stabilized rammed earth lintels presented in the literature.},

The variation of mechanical characteristics related to moisture content and suction are presented. This paper shows that a slight increase in the moisture content of dry rammed-earth is not followed by sudden drop in wall strength. Qualitative explanations at the nano-scale are presented.},

   abstract = {Earthen buildings can provide an answer to face difficulties in modern constructions in both terms of sociology, economics as well as ecology. However, the difficulty to understand and to predict their long term behavior represents an obstacle to their spreading. In some cases for example, unsuitable repairs on old constructions can lead to catastrophic situations. More specifically, during their lifetime, earthen walls have to face important variations of indoor and outdoor relative humidity, which induces variations and gradients in their water content. In this context, this paper aims at addressing an important aspect, not yet fully understood: the impact of these variations on the deformability and the strength of unstabilized earth. To that purpose, unconfined compression tests, with and without unload–reload cycles, were performed on different compacted earth samples conditioned at different relative humidities. Tested samples were prepared from materials coming from different existing constructions and sieved at 10mm. During the tests, the axial and radial strains were measured using non-contact sensors and an image correlation system. This study shows that earthen materials have a complex mechanical behavior, involving the phenomena of plastic straining and mechanical damage. Moreover, both of these phenomena show a strong dependence on the relative humidity at which the samples were stored, as well as on the activity of the clayey portion of the earth.},

The R-value for rammed earth walls is low hence they might be expected to conduct heat into a building during summer. However the large mass of these walls and the associated thermal lag in heat transfer from outside to inside may result in the walls performing satisfactorily in a building which is only occupied during working hours. Internal rammed earth walls may act as moderators of large diurnal temperature swings helping to produce an even comfortable temperature within a building. Empirical (in situ) measurements of temperature and heat flux were taken on the walls of an existing rammed earth office building in New South Wales, Australia during the summer. An analysis was performed which established a methodology to measure the heat flow associated with the walls, floor, ceiling, windows and infiltration for one office during occupied hours and the net energy transferred between the office and these elements was established. During this time the earth walls performed well. External walls were found to transmit comparatively little heat to the office and the internal walls absorbed heat during this time. Diffuse sky radiation transmitted by the window and infiltration are both likely to be important factors in the summer heat load.},

The moist region was modelled with material characteristics corresponding to partially saturated and nearly saturated adobe. The results showed the detrimental effect of moisture along the lower portion of the wall on the out-of-plane lateral strength. The out-of-plane lateral strength reduction ratio dropped significantly as L increased. A high slenderness ratio was found to be critical for cantilever adobe walls when L extended beyond half of the wall length.

The paper first reviews the state-of-the-art in experimental and computational research of adobe structures and then presents results obtained from monotonic lateral loading laboratory tests on a 1:2 scaled unreinforced adobe masonry building. Through the experimental investigation conducted, useful conclusions concerning the initiation and propagation of cracking failure are deduced. In addition, damage limit states at different levels of deformation are identified. Experimental results verify that the response of adobe structures to horizontal loads is critically affected by weak bonding between the masonry units and mortar joints and by lack of effective diaphragmatic function at roof level. Based on experimental material data, a 3D finite element (FE) continuum model is developed and calibrated to reproduce the test structure’s force–displacement response and mode of failure. An isotropic damaged plasticity constitutive law is adopted for the numerical simulation of adobe masonry and the use of appropriate modelling parameters is discussed. The FE analyses carried out reveal that the global structural behaviour is primarily influenced by the tensile response assigned to the homogenized masonry medium. Results show that, despite its generic limitations and simplifications, FE continuum macro-modelling can approximate the structural behaviour of horizontally loaded adobe masonry construction with sufficient accuracy. In order to enrich the available information on the seismic behaviour of adobe structures, the calibrated FE model is also subjected to time-history analysis using an accelerogram recorded during a real earthquake.},

In the present study the mineralogical, physical and mechanical characterization of adobe samples coming from seven different buildings in a poor state of conservation has been carried out together with an analysis of the “Local Earth” for comparison. The analyses showed the absence of any mixing intervention in the earth except for the possible addition of straw. It was also possible to discover which optimum amount of clay is needed in order to have the best mechanical characteristics for that kind of earth. Moreover it was possible to emphasize that the new bricks, realized with the earth taken where the local masons indicated the presence of material suitable for the realisation of earth bricks, exhibit a mechanical behaviour similar to that of the old bricks with the best mechanical characteristics. Such earth can surely be utilised in consolidation interventions where substitutions and partial reconstructions of bricks are needed.},

About 50% of population in developing countries, including the majority of rural areas, and at least 20% of urban and marginal urban areas, lives in earth buildings. The main general objectives of this study are the behaviour characterisation of adobe and rammed earth constructions along with the research for the development of retrofitting and seismic performance enhancement solutions, considering the relevant earthen heritage built in Portugal. In fact, until the first half of the last century, earth was commonly adopted as a construction material in Portugal. Adobe was used in almost all types of construction in littoral centre, particularly in Aveiro region. The consolidation of the knowledge on this technique and on the mechanical behaviour of adobe masonry will play a fundamental role on the preservation of the earthen built heritage. In addition, it may contribute to the development of innovative earth construction solutions for new buildings, following current concerns but also respecting structural safety demands, which will allow accommodating the increasing interest on this type of building solutions. The mechanical properties of adobe units and mortars were studied and a series of tests for the characterization of the adobe masonry behaviour were carried out, in the Department of Civil Engineering of the University of Aveiro, namely: (i) bond strength and (ii) joint shear tests. Additionally, a full-scale adobe building model was subjected to monotonic and cyclic horizontal lateral loads until failure.

The acceleration time history record of the 1995 Kobe earthquake was used to simulate the ground motion for the strengthened model which was increased sequentially in increments of 25% of peak ground acceleration (PGA). Initial (hairline) cracks were observed in the in-plane wall of the model at a PGA of 0.439 g. Although the out-of-plane walls also sustained damages, the in-plane walls were the most damaged parts of the structure. The proposed strengthening method reduced the torsional irregularity of the structure. It also increased strength, ductility and energy dissipation capacities of the walls. The data of observed structural damages and building drift were used to propose four performance levels for the strengthened adobe structures corresponding to the applied PGAs of ground motion.},

   abstract = {With the current deterioration rate of existing infrastructure, the importance of intervention and preservation efforts such as on-site visual inspections, non-destructive evaluation, structural health monitoring (SHM), and building pathology are on the rise. A critical aspect of these intervention and preservation methods is the visualization and accessibility of large, heterogeneous data sets. To enable diverse stakeholders to make informed choices, data and metadata for the built environment needs to be directly integrated into a user's viewing environment. To address this challenge, a human-machine interface which organizes these types of data and provides actionable information is necessary. The main aim of this work is to develop a preliminary framework for documenting and visualizing data about the built environment both on and off site using a combination of image-based documentation and augmented reality (AR). While this work illustrates preliminary annotation mechanisms such as drawing, the concept of projecting data between the image-based environment and the AR environment is the main contribution of this work. This method was applied to test objects as well as case studies in SHM and building pathology.},

As the affordability, reliability and ease-of-use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) advances, the use of aerial surveying for cultural heritage purposes becomes a popular choice, yielding an unprecedented volume of high-resolution, geo-tagged image-sets of historical sites from above. As well, recent developments in photogrammetry technology provide a simple and cost-effective method of generating relatively accurate 3D models from 2D images. These techniques provide a set of new tools for archaeologists and cultural heritage experts to capture, store, process, share, visualise and annotate 3D models in the field. This paper focuses on the methodology used to document the cultural heritage site of Asinou Church in Cyprus using various state of the art techniques, such as UAV, photogrammetry and 3D printing. Hundreds of images of the Asinou Church were taken by a UAV with an attached high resolution, low cost camera. These photographic images were then used to create a digital 3D model and a 3D printer was used to create a physical model of the church. Such a methodology provides archaeologists and cultural heritage experts a simple and cost-effective method of generating relatively accurate 3D models from 2D images of cultural heritage sites.},

The model is based on scores given to seven building parameters that are usually easy to survey: building position within the structural aggregate, number of storeys above ground, construction timespan, structural class, presence of strengthening interventions, roof type, and pre-existing damage to structural elements. Usability coefficients are calibrated for each category of each parameter, by varying macroseismic intensity and regressing data from the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake in central Italy. The parameters contribute to the creation of a synthetic index, according to weights or loading computed through principal component analysis. Usability probability matrices are determined and they can be used for territorial scale scenario assessment, as shown with an application to an entire historical centre.},

The system is based on the data recorded by a small number of high sensitivity accelerometers, on remote automated frequency tracking and on a multivariate statistical analysis criterion for damage detection, combining data regression, principal component analysis and novelty analysis. The analysis of monitoring data highlights the main characteristics of the response of the tower to wind, swinging bells and low return period earthquakes. Despite the low levels of vibration in operational conditions, the system is seen able to track the time evolution of five natural frequencies of the structure and to successfully use such information for detecting anomalous deviations from normal conditions. More in general, the presented results show a promise towards a more widespread use of low-cost vibration-based monitoring systems for cultural heritage preservation.},

   abstract = {This article presents a response-only structural health monitoring technique that utilises cepstrum analysis and artificial neural networks for the identification of damage in civil engineering structures. The method begins by applying cepstrum-based operational modal analysis, which separates source and transmission path effects to determine the structure's frequency response functions from response measurements only. Principal component analysis is applied to the obtained frequency response functions to reduce the data size, and structural damage is then detected using a two-stage ensemble of artificial neural networks. The proposed method is verified both experimentally and numerically using a laboratory two-storey framed structure and a finite element representation, both subjected to a single excitation. The laboratory structure is tested on a large-scale shake table generating ambient loading of Gaussian distribution. In the numerical investigation, the same input is applied to the finite model, but the obtained responses are polluted with different levels of white Gaussian noise to better replicate real-life conditions. The damage is simulated in the experimental and numerical investigations by changing the condition of individual joint elements from fixed to pinned. In total, four single joint changes are investigated. The results of the investigation show that the proposed method is effective in identifying joint damage in a multi-storey structure based on response-only measurements in the presence of a single input. Because the technique does not require a precise knowledge of the excitation, it has the potential for use in online structural health monitoring. Recommendations are given as to how the method could be applied to the more general multiple-input case. © The Author(s) 2014.},

The implementation of algorithms to perform the continuous on-line identification of modal parameters based on structural responses to ambient excitation (automated Operational Modal Analysis) has permitted to create a very complete database with the time evolution of the bridge modal characteristics during more than 2 years. This paper describes the strategy that was followed to minimize the effects of environmental and operational factors on the bridge natural frequencies, enabling, in a subsequent stage, the identification of structural anomalies. Alternative static and dynamic regression models are tested and complemented by a Principal Components Analysis. Afterwards, the identification of damages is tried with control charts. At the end, it is demonstrated that the adopted processing methodology permits the detection of realistic damage scenarios, associated with frequency shifts around 0.2%, which were simulated with a numerical model. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Referring to the latter, one of the most studied systems which shows these characteristics is the bridge with crossing loads, such as the case of the railway bridge studied in present paper; in this case, the mass and the velocity of the train can be considered as " environmental" factors.This paper, after a brief description of the PCA method and one example of its application on time-invariant systems, presents the great potentialities of the methodology when applied to time-varying systems.

Such procedures usually rely on heuristic decisional criteria, hence demanding for independent checks with validation purposes.The aim of this paper is to propose an automated modal identification procedure, belonging to the class of SSI techniques and based on the popular tool of clustering analysis, and to exemplify its application in the operational modal analysis of two bridges, with different levels of complexity from the system identification viewpoint: a historic iron arch bridge and a long-span footbridge. In order to address reliability and accuracy of the procedure, the modal estimates automatically extracted from the data recorded on the two bridges were compared to those independently obtained by using well-established manual techniques. The results demonstrated very good accuracy and robust performance of the developed procedure, also in the case of weakly excited and closely spaced modes, so that its application to process the data collected in continuous monitoring systems seems highly promising. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {It is well known that changes in vibration features of structures due to damage may be masked by the effects of environmental variations. This influence has to be eliminated in the structural health-monitoring process, especially when a long-term in situ monitoring is expected. In the companion paper [1] a linear method based on principal component analysis (PCA) has been proposed and has shown encouraging results for linear or even weakly non-linear cases. The present paper concerns a further extension of the proposed method to handle non-linear cases, which may be encountered in some complex structures. The method involves a two-step procedure, namely a clustering of the data space into several regions and then the application of PCA in each local region. The application of local PCA allows performing a piecewise linearisation of the non-linear problem. A close look at the choice of the distortion function used in data clustering leads to two new clustering strategies. Whereas the first strategy is specifically suitable for the application treated in this paper, the second one is more general. The local PCA-based damage detection method is applied for the structural health monitoring of a real bridge using vibration data measured in situ over a one-year period. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {A damage detection method is proposed for structural health monitoring under varying environmental and operational conditions. The method is based on principal component analysis (PCA) applied to vibration features identified during the monitoring of the structure. The advantage of the method is that it does not require to measure environmental parameters because they are taken into account as embedded variables. The number of principal components of the vibration features is implicitly assumed to correspond to the number of independent environmental factors. Since the environmental effects may be effectively eliminated by the proposed procedure, the residual error of the PCA prediction model remains small if the structure is healthy, and it increases significantly when structural damage occurs. Novelty analysis on the residual errors provides a statistical indication of damage. In the present paper, the environmental conditions are assumed to have a linear (or weakly non-linear) effect on the vibration features, and the PCA-based damage detection method is illustrated using computer-simulated and laboratory testing data. The extension of the proposed method to non-linear cases is addressed in a companion paper where the efficiency of the method is verified using data obtained from a 1-year in situ monitoring of a bridge. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Purpose: In the early 2000s, a wave of new practices concerning the adaptive reuse (AR) of historic buildings into boutique hotels began in Yazd, Iran. This study presents the findings of a postoccupancy evaluation (POE) of adaptively reused historic buildings into boutique hotels. It aims to explore and prioritize the main factors of architecture's physical aspects in the adapted buildings. Design/methodology/approach: In order to carry out a POE, hotel guests' written reviews from online international and national travel platforms were analyzed. According to this preliminary analysis, a questionnaire was designed and randomly distributed among 300 hotel guests. The data obtained from the questionnaire were analyzed using SPSS software. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce a set of indicators into the main components. Findings: The findings revealed that “preliminary physical feasibility study and evaluation of building's functional potential” is the most important component with a weight of 0.709. Then, “adaptive reuse design” and “quality of building conservation” are placed with a weight of 0.232 and 0.058, respectively. The results show the mere attention of practitioners to architectural restoration rather than adapting historic buildings into boutique hotels in Yazd. Also, the lack of a specific framework for this purpose is felt in Iran. Research limitations/implications: Future research could evaluate the architectural aspects of historic buildings that have been converted into various functions from the main users' views. Practical implications: This research's main contribution is to recommend guidelines for more user-friendly boutique hotels. This includes principal components and their sub-indicators that should be considered in the AR process of historic buildings by conservators, investors and hoteliers. Also, the extracted factors can be implemented for boutique hotels' improvements in operation because they determine the order of priority from the users' viewpoint. Originality/value: This study introduces a new application of POE in the field of conservation of heritage assets and the hospitality industry; it focuses on the evaluation of the users' feedback regarding the architectural aspects of adaptively reused historic buildings into boutique hotels based on original empirical data.},
